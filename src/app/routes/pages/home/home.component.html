      <p class="col-p">There is a popular saying that “the easiest way of becoming bankrupt is by not paying attention
        to your
        expenses.” There is nothing that captures the importance of keeping track of your expenses better than that
        saying. Being aware of our spending habits is the best way of utilizing our money. When you know how much money
        you spend, it’s easy to balance your income with your spending and even save for the future.</p>
